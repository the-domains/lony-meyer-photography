  My name is Lony. I am from a small Island in the North Sea called Föhr,
  Germany. I have lived in California for a number of years now.      
  Photography has always been a passion of mine but not until recent years have
  I become more serious about the visual arts. Taking photos of interesting
  subjects is something I enjoy doing. I take my Nikon with me anywhere I go.
  Sometimes I think I annoy people, but who cares something very cool can be
  created that day!         I am very passionate about exotic animals; I have a
  collection of Tarantulas at home, which are cool to photograph.  I hope you
  take joy in looking at my work.
