I am from a small Island in the North Sea called FÃ¶hr, Germany. I have lived in California for a number of years now. Photography has always been a passion of mine but not until recent years have I become more serious about the visual arts. Taking photos of interesting subjects is something I enjoy doing. I take my Nikon with me anywhere I go. Sometimes I think I annoy people, but who cares something very cool can be created that day! I am very passionate about exotic animals; I have a collection of Tarantulas at home, which are cool to photograph. I hope you take joy in looking at my work.</p></article>
