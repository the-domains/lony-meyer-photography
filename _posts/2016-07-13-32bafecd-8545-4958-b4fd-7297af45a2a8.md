    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #008080; font-size: 12pt; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>The Viksdalen Church </strong>is the main&nbsp;parish church&nbsp;in&nbsp;Gaular Municipality&nbsp;in&nbsp;Sogn og Fjordane&nbsp;county,&nbsp;Norway. It is located in the village of&nbsp;Vik. The white, wooden church, which has 284 seats, was&nbsp;consecrated&nbsp;on 5 November 1848 by Dean Johan Gr&oslash;nnlund. The church was probably built using architectural drawings by&nbsp;Hans Linstow.</span></p>
